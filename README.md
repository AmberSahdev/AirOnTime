#### Would you like a way to avoid waiting at airports for delayed flights? 
#### Do you wish that there just existed a way to easily check how often a particular flight is delayed? 


#### [AirOnTime](http://www.aironti.me/) is a website that allows you to enter the flight number of the flight you are trying to book and quickly shows you how often the particular flight is delayed and what are the other reliable options for the same route.


You just enter your flight number, departure and arrival airport codes and hit search...

### And now you have the ability to book a flight for which you **won't have to wait 3 hours** at the airport ###

At the heart of this web application is the simplistic approach to getting information so that **you**, the user, can make an informed choice without spending too much time on it. 


The frontend is the usual HTML, CSS, Javascript with Bootstrap and Material Design for Bootstrap.

The backend is built with Python 2.7 and Django 1.10.5 . 
To scrape data from different sources, we use BeautifulSoup and Mechanize.
