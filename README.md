### Getting to one's destination on time is something that everyone values and that's why we built AirOnTime.


#### [AirOnTime](http://www.aironti.me/) is a website that enables you to enter the flight number of the flight you are looking forward to book and quickly shows you how often that particular flight is delayed and what are the other reliable options for the same route. 

### Knowing the On Time Reliability of your flight can help you make better decisions and manage your time well.

##### Don't waste your time waiting for your flight. Don't give your money to unreliable airlines. 


You just enter your flight number, departure and arrival airport codes and hit search...
