## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked with [GitHub issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/).
When adding a new issue, explain the problem and include additional details to
help maintainers reproduce the problem:


### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements include everything from suggestions to completely new features or
minor improvements to existing functionality. We're excited to hear your ideas! 


### Pull Requests

If you're interested in tackling an open issue, leave a comment and let us know your
intent.

After you've made the appropriate changes, open a new [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
Be sure to review the guidelines below!

#### How to Submit Pull Requests?

All changes must be reviewed before being merged into the codebase, and some
additional changes may be requested before the pull request is accepted. In order
to make this process as easy as possible, be sure to do the following:

* **Select your merge target** to be `staging` or a branch that has been branched off of `staging`
* **Provide a general summary** of the changes you've made in 1-3 sentences
* **Provide specific summaries in check-list format** (skip any that do not apply)
	* The application/testing changes should come first
	* The database changes should come next
	* The documentation changes should come last
* **Update any related documentation and tests**

## Styleguides

The following styleguides help us to keep the codebase consistent and readable.
Certain styles (i.e. the JavaScript Styleguide) are enforced by our build system while
others are not formally enforced. Regardless, please adhere to them as closely as possible.

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to the [Airbnb JavaScript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#airbnb-javascript-style-guide-). The build
_will_ fail if your code does not observe it.

### CSS Styleguide
All CSS must adhere to the [Bootstrap CSS Styleguide](https://getbootstrap.com/css/).


### Commit Styleguide

* Provide meaningful, complete commits
* Keep commit history tidy by squashing commits when appropriate (before pushing)
* Use the past tense ("added new feature" not "add new feature")
* Keep messages entirely lowercase and as concise as possible
* Do not end messages with a period

## Recognition model
All contributions are respected. All contributors will be recognized here.
